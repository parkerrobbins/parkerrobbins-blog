Hi, my name is Parker, and welcome to the Brainfoggy Linguist. On this blog, I hope to share quick thoughts on a variety of linguistics, science, and academia-related topics. My central goal, though, is to talk about my experience as a chronically ill graduate student. I hope that my tips, tricks, and experiences might be useful to other chronically ill grad students. I also hope to give others in the academic community a glimpse of what being a chronically ill grad student can look like --- and what it can feel like.

The first time I struggled academically as a result of illness was my second year of undergrad. I was diagnosed with [[https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/health-a-z/chronic-idiopathic-urticaria-ciu/][chronic idiopathic urticaria]], or chronic hives of an unknown origin. My skin was on fire, my hands and feet became painfully swollen, and I became more fatigued than I had ever known was possible. My allergist told me that I should not be upset about my hives because they are not life-threatening, and --- although I did not want to believe it at the time --- I internalized that message.

Skipping ahead, I decided to take some time after undergrad to work as a lab manager and research assistant. During that time, my hives mostly went away, but I was diagnosed with two new conditions, [postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome](http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30) (POTS) and [fibromyalgia](https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Fibromyalgia). After years of unexplained pain, dizziness, fatigue, and a variety of other symptoms, I finally had some diagnoses. Unfortunately, my problems did not end there. These are two complex and poorly understood conditions that can be difficult to treat.

Dealing with these conditions can feel like a full-time job. I cannot tell you the number of hours I've spent in appointments, on the phone with insurance, and waiting at the pharmacy. That's before you account for all of the extra time sleeping, riding out intense flares, and engaging in self-care activities.

Despite these hurdles, I've made it work. I've balanced a full-time job with these conditions, I've successfully applied to and nearly completed an intense one-year MA program, and I've been accepted to a PhD program. It has not been easy, but I've learned some things that have made it easier. This is what I'd like to share with you.
