1.  "I wish you had told me what was going on."
    
    In a workshop on professional communication, I was once told that it
    is a "best practice" to let your supervisor know if there is
    anything going on in your personal life that might be impacting your
    work. Don't get me wrong — having faculty members who care about
    your well-being is great.
    
    However, choosing to disclose an illness is a decision that should
    not be taken lightly. Even if it is not intentional on their parts,
    it can change how people interact with you, how they view your work,
    and even whether they think its worth your time to advise you. When
    chronically ill students do choose to disclose an illness, we have
    decided that the benefits of sharing that information outweigh the
    risks — we don't want to hear that we should have told you sooner.

2.  "Parker has been having migraines, so he can't make it today."
    
    It is *never* okay to comment on a student's health condition
    without their explicit permission. Even with explicit permission, I
    would avoid it. Mentioning the reason someone was absent may seem
    harmless, but they may not want to disclose their illness or may not
    want it being discussed when they are not present.

3.  "Please let me know in advance if you plan to use your
    accommodations."
    
    I've read this in several syllabi, often in the context of
    extensions on written work. This is very much contrary to the nature
    of chronic illness: having a chronic illness means that you can't
    rely on your body the same way an able-bodied person can. If a
    chronically ill student needs more time on a paper, it's probably
    due to symptoms that we did not know in advance we would be
    experiencing.

4.  "Sleep can wait until after this deadline."
    
    This isn't usually stated explicitly, but staying up late or pulling
    all-nighters is a common practice among grad students and faculty
    alike. Whether you have a chronic illness or not, this is unhealthy
    behavior. When skipping sleep to work is normalized, however, it
    hurts chronically ill students more. An able-bodied person might be
    able to skip a night of sleep and recover within a couple of days;
    the last time I felt pressured to skip a night of sleep to meet a
    deadline, it took me 1.5 weeks to get back to my baseline level of
    fatigue.

5.  "Are you feeling better?"
    
    This might seem like a kind question, and I do genuinely appreciate
    when people who care ask how I'm doing. In fact, in the right
    context, it can be a kind question (e.g. after a particularly
    difficult flare). However, proceed with caution: this can be an
    insensitive question. A chronic illness is not like a cold; in many
    cases, it will last for years and may not ever go into remission. It
    can be frustrating, when *better* is unattainable, to be reminded of
    this fact.
